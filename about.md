Hey, welcome to my site!

My name is Pawe≈Ç and I'm passionate about new technologies, programming, automation stuff and many other things not strictly related to the topic of this blog :) 

The idea of this site is simple. Through my programming journey I have encountered many problems that seem repetitive and to which I have often not found a clear answer. Moreover I read and learn a lot of interesting things which can be helpful or inspirational to someone (I hope!). 

So, sometimes there will appear some stuff about my current problems, challenges, thoughts and I will be glad if even one person will find this site helpful! :)
